He played for the Detroit Tigers from 2012 to 2013, then was traded to the Texas Rangers in 2014.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Prince Fielder win a championship?</h2><p>Fielder never won a championship during his MLB career.Fielder was the NL Hank Aaron Award winner in 2007, AL Comeback Player of the Year in 2015, a three-time Silver Slugger Award winner (2007, 2011, 2012), and six-time All-Star (2007, 2009, 2011-13, 2015).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Prince Fielder make it to the Hall of Fame?</h2><p>No. Even though Fielder put up an outstanding performance in his career, he has never been a Hall of Famer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many MVPs did Prince Fielder win?</h2><p>During the 2011 82nd All-Star Game, he was named MVP.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many career points did Prince Fielder score?</h2><p>Throughout the 12 seasons he played for the Brewers, Rangers, and Tigers, he had a .283 batting average, 1645 hits, 319 home runs, 1028 RBIs, and 862 runs.</p><p>On May 9, 1984, Prince Fielder whose birth name is Prince Semien Fielder was born in Ontario, California. He grew up around professional baseball as a fixture in the clubhouses with his father and even attended batting practice at times. When he was just 12 years old, Prince hit a home run into the upper deck of Tiger Stadium off of Tigers third base coach Terry Francona.</p><p>Prince Fielder went to Saint Edward’s School in Vero Beach, Florida, where he played junior varsity baseball. He then attended Florida Air Academy High School before transferring to Eau Gallie High School. He was named the All-Space Coast Player of the Year in 2002 by Florida Today after hitting .524 with 10 home runs and 41 RBI in his senior season.</p><p>About his career, Fielder was selected with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2002 MLB Draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. He started his career in the minors and made his big-league debut with the Brewers on June 13, 2005. He bounced between the minors and majors some more that year, and then in 2006 became the Brewers starting first baseman. Fielder broke the record for most home runs by a rookie and became the youngest player in National League history to hit 50 home runs. He was the first Brewer to win the Home Run Derby and became one of a select few players to win more than one Home Run Derby. Fielder was the first player to win the Derby as both an American League and National League All-Star.</p><p>Fielder played the first seven years of his career in Milwaukee before signing with the Detroit Tigers in 2012. In November 2013, he was traded to the Rangers where he spent the rest of his career. A second neck surgery within three years would end his career, and he was released by Texas in 2017.</p><p>He ended his career with 319 home runs, the same number as his father, and a batting average of .283 with 1,028 runs batted in. Fielder is a member of the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmpoqaTmnqntcSlm56qo2KuuK3RnapmmZ6Zeqm7zaiprGWRobluxc6uZKedlZl6tbuMpKWor18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html&text=Prince%20Fielders%20Awards%20And%20Honors%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html&title=Prince%20Fielders%20Awards%20And%20Honors%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html&title=Prince%20Fielders%20Awards%20And%20Honors%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html&title=Prince%20Fielders%20Awards%20And%20Honors%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-fielders-awards-and-honors-all-you-need-to-know.html&description=Prince%20Fielders%20Awards%20And%20Honors%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./denise-welch-husband-meet-lincoln-townley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Denise Welch Husband: Meet Lincoln Townley">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nina-toussaint-white.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nina Toussaint-White movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
