Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu are the group’s nine members.&nbsp;In November 2021, they released their third Korean studio album, Formula of Love: O+T=3, which included the group’s first English-language smash song, The Feels.</p><p>TWICE, the world-famous K-pop girl group, completed its U.S. tour on February 27, 2022. While the band gave fans a night to remember, Momo recounted an upsetting experience during the concert’s final song.&nbsp;Momo said in an interview that she struck her head onstage while changing for her previous performance, causing her severe agony.</p><h2>Momo of TWICE tells her backstage tale.</h2><p>TWICE members recounted their experiences while playing their second-to-last performance at the USB Arena in New York City via a live TikTok broadcast. Momo, a member of the group, stated that she had a mistake backstage when discussing their great event. The singer said she had a concussion before the ladies took the stage to perform SCIENTIST. She added that a low barrier was built backstage near where the group changed into their following performance attire and frequently remained bent down when returning to the stage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/TWICE-Momo-2.jpg alt="TWICE Momo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She claimed that she was so excited about how great the last performance went that she forgot to bend down and struck her head on a massive pillar as a consequence. Furthermore, she bit her tongue so hard that it started to bleed simultaneously. Momo’s injuries had left her so disturbed that she broke into tears and felt she’d lost her memory. According to the artist,</p><p>“I was in a condition where I feared I was about to lose my memory, so I went to Jeongyeon and begged him, ‘What should I do?'”</p><p>Momo said that she was in great agony and was weeping, but she still walked on stage with the other members to perform SCIENTIST. She said,</p><p>“My eyes couldn’t seem to focus. While crying, I asked myself, “What should I do?””</p><p>TWICE’s Jeongyeon applauded Momo’s performance despite her injuries during the live broadcast. Nayeon noted that since they didn’t have a lengthy pause to change their clothes, all of the members rushed before performing the song, and anybody might have hit their head like Momo.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/TWICE-Momo-3.jpg alt="TWICE Momo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After Momo was injured, all of the members were concerned. Chaeyoung said that she was so worried about Momo that she forgot the words of SCIENTIST. She revealed,</p><p>“I was thinking about you when I forgot to sing my line and instead sung half the lyrics.”</p><p>Mina also said that she made errors in her choreography while trying to watch Momo throughout the performance. The effect of the injury was so severe that Momo had no recollection of playing the song after the event.</p><h2>Fans give their best wishes for Momo’s recovery and applaud her fortitude.</h2><p>When they saw and heard the words, the group’s followers, ONCE, rushed to social media to vent their displeasure. They also commended Momo for delivering an outstanding performance despite her head injury. According to supporters, Momo’s head injury is not the first time he has sustained one. On Knowing Bros, the primary dancer recounted a similar experience. Her companion slammed her into the wall, and consequently, her head began to bleed. Her grades started to fall after the event, and her English abilities deteriorated.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>After Momo suffers “head injury” while on tour in NY, the members can’t keep their eyes on Momo 😭<br>*They are FAMILY bro, and no one can change that! ♥️ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/YeDH5O9wbI</a></p><p>— Ayeena Dee (@AyeenaDee) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 2, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Momo.. please.
