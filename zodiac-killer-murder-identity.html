His first three targets were couples in secluded areas; two of these people survived. His last known victim was a taxi driver killed on October 11, 1969, in San Francisco. During and after his killing spree, Zodiac received attention and spread fear as he shared ciphers, letters, information and threats with authorities and the public.

Therefore the investigation followed more standard steps, such as checking out Jensen's ex-boyfriend.

They refused to hear anything else."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Less than seven months later in the early morning hours of July 5, 1969, Darlene Ferrin, 22, and Mike Mageau, 19, were shot multiple times while sitting in Ferrin's car at the Blue Rock Springs Golf Club in Vallejo, California. Ferrin was killed, but Mageau survived the wounds to his jaw, shoulder and leg.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Less than an hour following the attack, Zodiac phoned the Vallejo police department to report the crime. During the call, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/yesterdays-crimes-news/yesterdays-crimes-the-zodiac-killers-first-known-victim-died-50-years-ago/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he stated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he stated</a>: "I also killed those kids last year," a reference to Faraday and Jensen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On September 27, 1969, 22-year-old Cecilia Shepard and 20-year-old Bryan Hartnell were having a picnic at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. They were approached by a man wearing a hood that bore a symbol of two intersecting lines in a circle. The man used a gun to threaten Shepard and Hartnell, tied them up, then stabbed the pair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both Shepard and Hartnell were alive when help arrived. Shepard ended up succumbing to her wounds, but Hartnell recovered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On October 11, 1969, in San Francisco, Zodiac entered the cab of Paul Stine, 29, as a passenger. While in the taxi, Zodiac shot Stine in the head.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Witnesses saw Stine's murder, so police were soon on the scene. The witnesses had described the murderer as white, around 25 to 30 years old, wearing glasses and sporting a crew cut. Police, who assumed the killing was a robbery, spotted a man matching this description — but a dispatcher had mistakenly told them the suspect was a Black person. The man was allowed to leave, and the Zodiac Killer was not caught.</p><img alt="Zodiac Killer Wanted poster" title="Zodiac Killer Wanted poster" width=3148 height=4053 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/zodiac-killer-mug---getty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images</span><p>Wanted poster for the Zodiac Killer</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Zodiac would send letters to newspapers with cryptic clues</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his July 1969 attack, the Zodiac Killer began to contact newspapers via letters that included details only the killer would know. And in addition to phoning the police after the murders he committed in July, he made a phone call confession to law enforcement in September. The Zodiac Killer took responsibility for Stine's death in a letter postmarked October 13, 1969, enclosing a piece of the driver's bloodied shirt. He also reached out to the police by phone several days following that crime.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a letter <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2017/11/Zodiac-Letter_4.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The San Francisco Examiner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The San Francisco Examiner</a> received on August 4, 1969, he wrote, "This is the Zodiac speaking," marking his first use of the name "Zodiac." That opening salutation would be repeated in many letters. His messages also often included a crosshairs symbol, which resembled the sight on a rifle — the same symbol on the hood worn during his September 1969 attack.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zodiac seemed to enjoy the publicity he received. He took steps to ensure messages were widely shared, such as threatening to go on a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2017/11/Zodiac-Letter_2.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"kill rampage"' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"kill rampage"</a> unless a cipher was printed in the San Francisco Chronicle, then issuing a separate threat to have a cipher published in The San Francisco Examiner.

Zodiac claimed he'd shared his identity in another coded message. Yet despite decades of trying, no other Zodiac cipher has been officially solved.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Zodiac went silent for almost three years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2017/11/Zodiac-Letter_6.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="letter Zodiac sent taking responsibility for Stine's murder" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">letter Zodiac sent taking responsibility for Stine's murder</a> also declared, "School children make nice targets. I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire + then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out." The threat was published on October 17, 1969, and resulted in heightened fears and a greater police presence: officers guarded buses, helicopters kept watch from above and curfews were put into effect in several counties. Some parents opted to keep their children home from school entirely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1969, Zodiac was consistently front-page news, while the knowledge that an unhinged serial killer was on the loose terrified the public. People rushed to call tip lines with the slightest information, overwhelming the police. Among letters that came in 1970 were threats to bomb a school bus and orders for residents of San Francisco to wear buttons with the crosshairs Zodiac symbol.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zodiac letters and notes, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2017/11/Zodiac-Letter17.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="including one" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">including one</a> declaring that each new victim meant "the more slaves I will collect for my afterlife," arrived until March 1971. Then Zodiac went silent until January 29, 1974, when he sent a new letter that noted, "Me – 37, SFPD – 0." This was seen as a claim he'd taken 37 lives. A few more letters and postcards arrived that year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There was silence again until 1978 when <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=p2bS3thnD5YC" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a letter purportedly from Zodiac" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a letter purportedly from Zodiac</a> was sent to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, the legitimacy of the letter was questioned, as the handwriting and tone differed from earlier Zodiac communications. In addition, the discovery that year that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/obituaries/david-toschi-86-detective-who-pursued-the-zodiac-killer-dies.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a San Francisco detective had faked letters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a San Francisco detective had faked letters</a> to the editor praising his own work on the case made some wonder if the detective had also falsified this Zodiac letter, something the detective and San Francisco police denied.

Did he stop killing? Popular culture often depicts serial killers as operating under irresistible compulsions, but under certain circumstances, they can refrain from murder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime</a> has noted that serial killers may stop if something changes in their lives. Perhaps coming so close to getting caught on the night of Stine's murder scared Zodiac onto a safer path. Another possibility is that the terror he fomented in the public served as a substitute for killing. In addition, simply growing older may dampen predatory impulses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A psychology professor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkUAQAAIAAJ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="who wrote a book about Zodiac" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">who wrote a book about Zodiac</a> has posited that the murderer may have recovered from dissociative identity disorder, otherwise known as multiple personalities. With recovery came an end to his desire to kill. It's also possible Zodiac stopped taking lives for a reason outside his control, such as institutionalization, incarceration or his own death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Or perhaps Zodiac continued to hunt victims, but in a different way. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2017/11/Zodiac-Letter-8.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A letter postmarked November 12, 1969" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">A letter postmarked November 12, 1969</a>, had threatened, "I shall no longer announce to anyone when I comitt my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & few fake accidents, etc." Without knowing the killer, it's impossible to be certain whether his violence ceased.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Zodiac has never been identified</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both members of law enforcement and amateur sleuths continue to track the Zodiac Killer. Their work relies on the original investigations handled separately by law enforcement in Vallejo, Napa County and San Francisco. The case was not under federal jurisdiction, though the FBI provided support for analyzing handwriting, fingerprints and decoding Zodiac's messages.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the years, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Amateurs-Stir-Embers-Of-Notorious-Zodiac-Case-3303028.php data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more than 2,500 suspects were considered" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">more than 2,500 suspects were considered</a>, ranging as far afield as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/ted-kaczynski data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Unabomber Ted Kaczynski" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Unabomber Ted Kaczynski</a>.

In addition, Allen's fingerprints did not match prints from Stine's taxi, and in 2002, DNA pulled from a Zodiac-sent stamp did not match Allen's. However, the DNA sample was small and the results somewhat inconclusive — plus Allen often had other people lick stamps for him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today's more advanced DNA techniques offer the tantalizing possibility of a definitive answer regarding who the Zodiac is, or was.
