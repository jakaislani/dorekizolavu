She was a 90’s notable singer and musical personality.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There must be very few people who haven’t heard the jazz song, The Girl from Ipanema as in the mid-1960s it was a worldwide hit and in 1965 won a Grammy for Record of the Year. Well, the woman behind this song is Astrud Gilberto, a bossa nova and a Brazilian samba singer.</p><p>An avid advocate of animal rights, Astrud received several recognitions for her contributions to the music industry.</p><p>In 1992, for Lifetime Achievement, she received the Latin Jazz USA Award and in 2002, she was inducted into the Music Hall of Fame of International Latin Music.</p><p>Unfortunately, the musical persona passed away on 5th June 2023, leaving behind a notable legacy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Payton Washington Parents: Father Kelan Washington And Mother</a></p><h2>Astrud Gilberto Husband <a class=fl href=# data-ved=2ahUKEwjrmMmmjq__AhXeRWwGHU4gC7cQmxMoAHoECCkQAg rel=noopener>João Gilberto</a></h2><p>Following Astrud’s death at the age of 83, people are searching for her personal life now and want to know more about Astrud Gilberto husband. Well, the musical artist was first married to a Brazilian guitarist, and singer named Joao Gilberto.</p><p>The pair exchanged their wedding vows in 1959 and were together for several years until their divorce in the mid-1960s. The former pair used to collaborate in several musical projects including the collaboration on The Girl from Ipanema’s hit recording.</p><p>Astrud Gilberto’s first husband was often called the “father of bossa nova” since in the late 1950s, he was the pioneer of bossa nova, a musical genre.</p><p>One of the main reasons’ for the former couple to be connected and bonded was the fact that they both shared a common interest and passion for music. However, despite several reasons, they decided to part ways.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Astrud-Gilberto-husband.jpg><p>Still, after their separation, both Astrud and Joao moved on with their lives smoothly. While Gilberto went on to marry <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicholas Lasorsa, </a>Joao found his love in singer Miucha.</p><p>The singer was in a happy and thriving marriage with her second husband, Nicholas Lasorsa and everything was going well between them. However, since Astrud wasn’t lucky in love, her second marriage also resulted in divorce.</p><p>Following her second separation, she stayed away from the media limelight and kept her romantic life private and low-key.</p><p>Later, as per rumors, Gilberto began an intimate relationship with her spouse’s musical collaborator, Stan Getz, an American jazz saxophone player. However, their relationship never turned into marriage.&nbsp;</p><h2>Meet Girl From Ipanema Son Marcelo Gilberto</h2><p>Although Astrud couldn’t be a good wife to her two husbands, there is no denying that she was a great and doting mother to her children.</p><p>From her first marriage with musician, Joao, she had the privilege to become a mother for the first time with the arrival of her son, Joao Marcelo Gilberto. Her first child, Marcelo is also involved in the musical sector and he even joined their parent’s band.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Astrud-Gilberto-children.jpg><p>Similarly, Astrud welcomed her second son named Gregory Lasorsa, from her second marriage. Gregory also played music with his mother and they shared a tight-knit bond.</p><p>Apart from this, not much has been revealed about Astrud Gilberto’s kids, since they have stayed away from the media limelight. Besides, the musical artist faced many challenges in her personal life and musical career, yet she stood strong and raised her sons to be headstrong as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Also Be Interested In:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Jordan Neely Parents: Mother Christie Neely and Father Andre Zachery</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jpqqraqlmXqotcubnKusn2K1tr%2FBmqWdZZ2asrV50qilZqWRp7CmuM5mnqKkkpq%2FtbuO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html&text=Astrud%20Gilberto%20Husband%20Joo%20Gilberto%20And%20Son%20Marcelo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html&title=Astrud%20Gilberto%20Husband%20Joo%20Gilberto%20And%20Son%20Marcelo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html&title=Astrud%20Gilberto%20Husband%20Joo%20Gilberto%20And%20Son%20Marcelo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html&title=Astrud%20Gilberto%20Husband%20Joo%20Gilberto%20And%20Son%20Marcelo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fastrud-gilberto-husband-meet-son-marcelo-gilberto.html&description=Astrud%20Gilberto%20Husband%20Joo%20Gilberto%20And%20Son%20Marcelo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bachelor-party-1984.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bachelor Party movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1984)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./top-10-most-memorable-alan-arkin-movie-roles-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 most memorable Alan Arkin movie roles, ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
