His extended play “NF” became his ticket to fame, and has been followed by three successful studio albums.</p><p>So how much is NF’s net worth? As of late 2017, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $450,000, acquired from his years in the music industry which began in 2010.</p><h3>NF Net Worth $450,000</h3><p>Born in Gladwin, Michigan, NF had a rough childhood; his parents divorced when he was young and he was raised by his father; his mother overdosed on drugs apparently after being abused by her boyfriend. He attended Gladwin High School and became part of the school’s basketball team. He matriculated in 2009, and started to pursue a career in music by joining “Fine Arts Festival”.</p><p>NF began his career recording his songs through a karaoke machine. In 2010, he released his independent album “Moments” under his real name Nathan Feuerstein, but only achieved minor success. Still, his early years creating music laid the basis to his net worth.</p><p>Around 2010, NF also started working on a self-titled extended play or EP, but it took him a long time to release it due to differences with his previous label Xist Music. Finally, in 2014 he signed a deal with Capitol CMG, and his EP “NF” was finally released, which became a hit, and immediately went to the top of the Billboard charts.</p><p>In 2015, NF released his first studio album entitled “Mansion”, and his song “Intro” became a hit and was even included in the video game “Madden NFL 16”. Several of his other songs were also used in various television shows, including “Grimm”, “Shades of Blue”, and “Chicago P.D.” In 2016, he released another album, entitled “Therapy Sessions” and carrying the songs “I Just Wanna Know” and “Real.” The success of his albums helped tremendously in his career and also his net worth.</p><p>Aside from his own songs, NF has also worked with other artists, and was featured in Flame’s “Start Over”, Futuristic’s song “Epiphany”, and <a href=#>TobyMac’s</a> “’Til the Day I Die.” These collaborations with other artists have also helped in his wealth.</p><p>Today, NF is still active in the music industry, and in 2017 released a new album entitled “Perception”, that debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.</p><p>NF has also received accolades through the years. In 2016 he received the Dove Award for the Best Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year for “Therapy Session”, and his song “Oh Lord” won the Dove Award for Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year for 2017.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, NF has been dating Bridgette Doremus, a fitness coach and founder of Stripped Fitness, since 2016.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.22859450727><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$450,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 30, 1991</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Gladwin, Michigan, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Hip hop music artist, rapper, artist, songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Gladwin High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/nfrealmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/nfrealmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/nfrealmusic/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm8288922</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29090909090909><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nf-mn0003282827</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Dove Award for Best Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year (2016)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>Capitol, Capitol CMG, Xist, NF Real Music LLC</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Albums</td><td>Moments (2010), Beautiful Addiction (2013), Mansion (2015), Therapy Session (2016, studio album), Perception (2017)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Dove Award for Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year (2016, 2017)</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Movies</td><td>Flame ft NF “Start Over”, Futuristic ft.
