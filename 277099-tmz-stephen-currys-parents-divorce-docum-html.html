Dell now serves as the color commentator for the Charlotte Hornets.

Sonya also made a name for herself as an athlete. She played volleyball and was a serious, determined, self-motivated team leader.</p><p class=dh>When Sonya Curry was in the eighth grade at Tadford High School, she was promoted to the varsity volleyball team courtesy of the local high school's volleyball coach, John Pierce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3bd2196fc1b89e62a53588a50263093e7f0fe7c316347726181f63b34f7be081.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Stephen Curry and his parents Dell Curry and his mother Sonya Curry at Warriors headquarters in Oakland, California on June 26, 2009. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>By the time she reached her senior year, her school had secured the state AA championship, and she had earned recognition as Virginia's defensive player of the year. Sonya not only played volleyball; she also made her mark in basketball, excelling as a defensive specialist and leading the Radford girls to two state titles.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, Sonya Curry showcased her skills on the state stage in track and field by competing in events such as the 400-meter hurdles and sprint relays. As she approached the end of her high school journey, Sonya received numerous college offers, with some institutions expressing interest in her talents for both volleyball and basketball.</p><p class=dh>Despite being a talented athlete, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/ostler/article/How-Splash-Mothers-begat-the-Warriors-12460274.php>Steph's mother </a>never pushed her children into sports.

It was during this time that she got involved in an accident, and her car was wrecked. She said the accident was a sign for her not to attend James Madison University.</p><p class=dh>Instead, she decided to remain closer to her home and ultimately selected Virginia Tech as her college destination. During her official recruiting visit to the university, she first crossed paths with Dell Curry. While observing a Men's Basketball practice, Sonya noticed Dell and the feeling was mutual—it was love at first sight.</p><p class=dh>They tied the knot in 1988 and were blessed with three children: Steph, Seth, and Sydel. While Steph and Seth have achieved significant success as athletes, Sydel pursued a different career path. However, she, too, made a mark for herself by participating in college volleyball.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Steph Curry's</a> parents were often at their children's games, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/05/warriors-trail-blazers-steph-curry-seth-curry-parents-rooting>rooting for their sons</a> Steph and Seth's teams. In 2019, it was an entirely new experience for them to watch their sons play against each other for the first time. Steph, who plays for the Golden State Warriors, hosted Seth, who was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers.</p><p class=dh>In an interview, Steph Curry's parents shared their approach of how they decided <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/sports/curry-sonya-dell-steph-seth.html>which son</a> they would cheer for in each game. According to Steph's mother, Sonya, they had agreed to flip a coin, and the coin toss outcome would determine which jersey each parent would wear and which son they would support during the game.</p><p class=dh>Sonya described the experience as enjoyable and a true blessing. She expressed her excitement about watching her sons play, with a particular anticipation for watching Seth in action. She emphasized she was eager to see <a class="me a" href=#>Seth Curry</a> excel by stealing the ball and shooting over Steph.</p><p class=dh>Steph also shared the experience, calling it a win-win situation for their parents. Sonya also stated that even though one of her sons' teams would go home, she was excited that the other team was going for the championship.</p><p class=dh>In 2021, Stephy Curry's parents decided to go their separate ways after 33 years of marriage.

She also alleged that Dell's affair was known to family and friends.</p><p class=dh>On the other hand, Dell alleged in the divorce documents that Sonya was the unfaithful one. He accused Sonya of marital misconduct and lying about it. Dell also claimed at the time that Sonya had already moved in with another man and suggested that she was no longer eligible to receive alimony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtucGhpbnq1udlmqq2doJ2yr3nCrqmrsaNivaK%2BxKerrGWUnsOwvsKeZJ2nk6q6b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html&text=Steph%20Curry%27s%20Parents%20Dell%20and%20Sonya%20Curry%20Spent%20Decades%20Together%20before%20Their%20Split&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html&title=Steph%20Curry%27s%20Parents%20Dell%20and%20Sonya%20Curry%20Spent%20Decades%20Together%20before%20Their%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html&title=Steph%20Curry%27s%20Parents%20Dell%20and%20Sonya%20Curry%20Spent%20Decades%20Together%20before%20Their%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html&title=Steph%20Curry%27s%20Parents%20Dell%20and%20Sonya%20Curry%20Spent%20Decades%20Together%20before%20Their%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f277099-tmz-stephen-currys-parents-divorce-docum-html.html&description=Steph%20Curry%27s%20Parents%20Dell%20and%20Sonya%20Curry%20Spent%20Decades%20Together%20before%20Their%20Split" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-asrock-b450-gaming-itx-ac-and-b450-gaming-k4-motherboard-reviews-fatal1ty-on-a-b450-budget.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="System Performance - The ASRock B450 Gaming ITX/ac and B450 Gaming K4 Motherboard Reviews">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lion-2016.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lion movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
