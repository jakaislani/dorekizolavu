But many netizens were not buying the news and called it fake news and a ploy to stir up advertise.</p><p>After Chinese media reported that the couple had been spotted dining just three days after their announcement of a break-up in a Thai restaurant, their doubts were raised by hundreds of fold. Both of them, however, have not provided the formal declaration of their feasible reconciliation.</p><p>Li Chen and Bingbing began their relationship in early 2015. Then on September 16, 2017, at the end of her birthday, Li proposed Bingbing with a ring. They also lived together in the same apartment while they were together.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary&nbsp;</h2><p>As per the source, Bingbing's net worth is <strong>$103 million</strong>.
