You are overwhelmed about a new canine companion but sad about all the cute dogs you couldn’t get.</p><p>Hybrid dogs are currently gaining momentum in the pet market with thousands of new dog owners going for a mixed breed, also called a mutt. Among the various mixed breed options, a Pitbull-Chihuahua hybrid is one of the most unconventional dogs. The designer dog is receiving traction for its unique look and temperament inherited from its adorable-looking parents.</p><h2 id=pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix></span> What Is A Pitbull and Chihuahua Mix?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Pitbull-Chihuahua mix is a designer dog born as the offspring of a purebred Pitbull and a purebred Chihuahua. The crossbreed is known by many names, including Pithuahua, Chipit, Mexican Bulldog, and Chitbull.</p><p>The Chipit can be bred either with a Pitbull dad and Chihuahua mom or vice versa. The physical attributes and characteristics of the resulting puppy can differ based on the gender of its parents.</p><p><strong>You May Like:</strong> 20 Small and Medium Dog Breeds Under 50 Pounds: Small But Mighty</p><h2 id=chipit-history><span class=ez-toc-section id=chihuahua-pitbull-mix-history></span> Chihuahua-Pitbull Mix History<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chihuahua-Pitbull mix reportedly originated during the early 1900s in the US. But, as the Chipit is not a recognized breed, very little is known about its history.</p><p>Meanwhile, experts believe that the mixed breed came into existence shortly after designer dogs became a trend in the 20th century. The main objective behind the hybrid was to breed a dog with the temperament of both a Chihuahua and a Pitbull. Breeders wanted the high-spirited personality and small size of a Chihuahua with the devotion and natural instincts of a Pitbull.</p><p>The mixed breed was first publicly introduced in the 2000s. Although the American Kennel Club does not recognize the Chipit, the International Designer Canine Registry (IDCR) and the Dog Registry of America, Inc. (DRA) approve it as a breed.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=chihuahua-originated-in-mexico></span>Chihuahua Originated In Mexico<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chipit parent Chihuahua is a toy dog breed native to Mexico. The breed is believed to be a descendant of a mute dog breed called Techichi.</p><p>The smallest dogs in the world, Chihuahuas were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1904.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=pitbull-originated-in-the-us></span>Pitbull Originated In The US<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Pitbull (or American Pit Bull Terrier) was first registered as a breed by the United Kennel Club on February 10, 1898. The breed was developed as a crossbreed between a terrier dog and a bulldog.</p><p>The Pitbull was initially bred for bloodsports, including bull baiting, bear baiting, and dog fighting.</p><h2 id=physical-appearance><span class=ez-toc-section id=pitbull-chihuahua-mix-physical-appearance></span> Pitbull-Chihuahua Mix Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chipit can differ in appearance, depending upon the genetic characteristics they derive from their parents. The pup could have the athletic build of a Pitbull or the petite body of a Chihuahua.</p><p><strong>You May Like: </strong>25 Largest Dog Breeds By Weight and Height</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=size-measurements></span>Size & Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Chipit comes in different sizes, ranging from small to medium. As the offspring of two vastly different breeds, the size of a Chipit depends on whether it inherited the physical traits of a Chihuahua or a Pitbull.</p><p>On average, a Chipit grows around 10 to 20 inches in height and 15 to 35 pounds in weight.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=coat></span>Coat<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The coat of a Chipit also comes in multiple colors and patterns. The hybrid could grow a long and fluffier like the Chihuahua or a short and smooth coat like the Pitbull.</p><p>Their coat also ranges in shades of different colors, including black, brindle, brown, fawn, and white.</p><h2 id=chipit-temperament><span class=ez-toc-section id=pitbull-chihuahua-mix-temperament></span> Pitbull-Chihuahua Mix Temperament<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chipit is an affectionate dog with a sense of loyalty towards its family. As the offspring of two high-energy dogs, the Chipit is energetic and playful. They are fierce protectors of their families but can also show gentle traits around kids and other household pets.</p><p>The Pitbull-Chihuahua mix’s behavior doesn’t just depend on its parents but also on the family raising the dog and its immediate environment. Chihuahuas and Pitbulls often get a bad rep for being too aggressive. However, not many people realize that the aggressiveness of a dog depends on its training and socialization. Most dogs of either breed don’t show the antagonistic trait if they grew up around families and were properly trained.</p><p>Chipits are not that hard to train but often require a source of motivation like rewards and treats. They may behave stubbornly or refuse to follow commands if they are adequately motivated. While some dogs are influenced by food, others might be motivated by play times.</p><h2 id=taking-care-of-a-chipit><span class=ez-toc-section id=taking-care-of-a-pitbull-chihuahua-mix></span> Taking Care of A Pitbull-Chihuahua Mix<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Pitbull-Chihuahua Mix is a low-maintenance animal when compared to other breeds of similar stature. However, it still needs to be taken care of by the owner or a professional.</p><p>In many ways, owning a pet dog is like raising a child. From grooming requirements to proper training, there are several things to take care of even for the lowest-maintenance ones.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-training-requirements></span>1. Training Requirements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Like most pure breeds, the training of a Chipit should begin when the pup is around eight weeks old. The training should begin with easy-to-follow commands like stay, come, sit, and stand.</p><p>Rewarding the pup with treats or snacks helps in turning even the most stubborn ones into obedient little dogs. Likewise, crate training at a young age is also crucial. Make sure that the pooch understands that staying inside a crate is not a punishment. Here are a few techniques that can come in handy while training your furry friend:</p><li>Prioritize positive reinforcement over punishment</li><li>Be consistent with your training approach</li><li>Plan short but repeated training sessions</li><li>Reward the dog for small achievements</li><li>Make the training a part of their daily lives</li><li>Use hand signals with verbal commands</li><li>Attend a training class in advance</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-regular-exercise></span>2. Regular Exercise<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Chipit is a highly energetic dog that requires daily walking and exercise to burn off excessive energy. Planning two brief walking sessions of 15 minutes is proven to be more beneficial than a single daily session of 30 minutes.</p><p>Similarly, regularly playing with your canine pals will also help in meeting their daily exercise requirements. Besides physical activities, dogs also need regular mental stimulation. Playing games like hide and seek, socializing with other pets/dogs, and planning sniffing sessions are some of the basic mental stimulation that your companion requires.</p><p><strong>Explore:</strong> Hypoallergenic Big Dogs – The Best Large Pups for your Family</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-food-and-nutrition></span>3. Food And Nutrition<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Chihuahua-Pitbull mix needs protein-rich food to fulfill its dietary requirements. Whether you use dry or wet food, the protein content should be between 18% to 25%.</p><p>Similarly, the food should also contain 10% to 15% fat. Wet food usually has less fat than kibble. So, be sure to check the fat content before buying.&nbsp;</p><p>Overfeeding can be as dangerous as starving your pet pooch. So, instead of free-feeding your pet, plan 3-4 meals a day. On average, an adult Chipit will consume around 1.5-2 cups of food in a day.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-grooming-requirements></span>4. Grooming Requirements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While Chipits aren’t high-maintenance by any standard, they still require basic grooming and hygiene. For short coats, brush the hair 1-2 times a week to keep the shedding to a minimum. You might have to increase the brushing frequency for a medium-length coat.</p><p>Whether the offspring will acquire short or medium-length hair depends on the coat of the Chihuahua. The offspring of a short-haired Chihuahua will almost always be a short-haired pup, whereas the coat of the puppy born for medium-length-haired Chihuahua can range from short to medium-length coat.</p><p>The necessary bathing frequency differs on how dirty your dog normally gets. While you can bathe it as many times as necessary, use shampoo only once every 3-4 weeks. Regular use of shampoo can drastically affect the natural skin oil.</p><p>Also, the mixed breed dog is not hypoallergenic. If you are prone to catch allergies from your canine friend, the Pithuahua is not the best choice.</p><h2 id=chihuahua-pitbull-health><span class=ez-toc-section id=chihuahua-pitbull-mix-health-issues></span> Chihuahua-Pitbull Mix Health Issues<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On average, the Chihuahua-Pitbull offspring lives around 10 to 13 years. Its parents Chihuahua and Pitbull have an average lifespan of 12-20 years and 8-15 years.</p><p>As a mixed breed, the Chipit is considered generally healthier than many purebreds. However, the mutt can also develop several health-related issues. Conditions like hypoglycemia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, and heart problems are common, especially if one of its parents also suffered from the issue.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-patellar-luxation></span>1. Patellar Luxation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It is an orthopedic condition that causes dislocation of kneecaps. This condition is not just associated with the Pitbull-Chihuahua but with most small dog breeds. While this condition normally develops after a physical injury, it can also be hereditary in some cases. Breeds like Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers, and Toy Poodles are commonly associated with this condition.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-hypoglycemia></span>2. Hypoglycemia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hypoglycemia is a condition common in toy breeds. It is developed when the blood sugar level of a dog drops lower than 3.3 mmol/L. This condition is caused by a variety of factors, including cold weather, parasitic infection, and poor diet. Some common symptoms of Hypoglycemia are sweating, anxiety, dizziness, fast heartbeat, and confusion. If left unchecked, it could lead to severe health complications, and even death in some cases.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-obesity></span>3. Obesity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Chihuahua-Pitbull mix is susceptible to obesity as it is a major health issue common in both of its parents. However, the owners are equally responsible for the condition as obesity mostly arises due to overfeeding. So, it’s best to consult a vet before implementing a diet and feeding schedule. Lack of exercise and physical activities are also to blame for the conditions.</p><p>Besides the above-mentioned health issues, Chipit is also at risk of several other health conditions. Some of these are listed below:</p><ul><li>Dental problems like tooth decay, plaque buildup, and gum disease.</li><li>Skin and hair problems such as hair loss, skin infections, allergies, and itching.&nbsp;</li><li>Weight-related issues like joint problems, diabetes, and heart disease.</li><li>Glaucoma, progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, and other eye problems.</li></ul><h2 id=pitbull-chihuahua-mix-price><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-a-pitbull-chihuahua-mix-cost></span> How Much Does A Pitbull-Chihuahua Mix Cost?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A Pitbull-Chihuahua pup can cost anywhere between $200 to $800. The cost stated is only the price of buying the dog; you’ll have to pay separately for services and accessories like a crate, insurance, leash, and vet fee.</p><p>However, the major expense associated with a pet is its maintenance costs. According to TheDogPeople, the yearly cost of owning a Chipit will be between $1,135 to $5,155. Even if you are adopting a rescue puppy, you’ll be charged the adoption fee between $115 to $725. Take a look at some of the expenses incurred while raising a Pitbull-Chihuahua hybrid.</p><li>Spaying or neutering fee ($340-$1500)</li><li>Vet exam (initial) and vaccination fee ($340-$510)</li><li>Microchip implantation charge ($60-$80)</li><li>Regular vet exam ($110-$340)</li><li>Dog crate ($20-$100)</li><li>Potty Pads ($20-100)</li><li>Food ($25-$325)</li><h2 id=chipit-home-environment><span class=ez-toc-section id=compatible-home-environment-for-chipit-dog></span> Compatible Home Environment For Chipit Dog<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Chihuahua-Pitbull mix is a highly adaptable dog that can live in a variety of environments. As Chihuahuas and Pitbulls can both survive in hot to cold climates, their resultant offspring can also easily thrive in either environment.</p><p>Likewise, due to its small size, Chipit is an ideal choice for urban settlers and people living in small apartments. Dog experts recommend a backyard where the pup can regularly play and burn off its energy. Even if a backyard is not available, it won’t be a major issue for the pooch. However, make sure that there are dog parks nearby and that your dog regularly gets to visit the park.</p><p>The Chipit is a companion dog and could develop separation anxiety if left alone for hours. You can ease the anxiety by making sure that your pal has plenty of toys to play with when you are not there. But, the best way to remedy this problem is to get a second pet. So, even if you are not there, your pets have each other to keep company. Due to the high cost of owning a pet, this solution might not be ideal for all Chipit owners.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> 30 Small Dog Breeds for Apartments, First-Time Owners and Seniors</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyYmnqxsdGfnJysXZe5prrDZqeirJKqua15wKebZpuYnrW2rceumGalma18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html&text=The%20Perfect%20Blend%3a%20Pitbull%20and%20Chihuahua%20Mix&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html&title=The%20Perfect%20Blend%3a%20Pitbull%20and%20Chihuahua%20Mix" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html&title=The%20Perfect%20Blend%3a%20Pitbull%20and%20Chihuahua%20Mix" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html&title=The%20Perfect%20Blend%3a%20Pitbull%20and%20Chihuahua%20Mix" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-perfect-blend-pitbull-and-chihuahua-mix.html&description=The%20Perfect%20Blend%3a%20Pitbull%20and%20Chihuahua%20Mix" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-troop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Troop  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./liam-flockhart-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Liam Flockhart Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
